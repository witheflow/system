# Biosignal-based mixing rules based on stress and attention quadrants
rules:
  - name: high_stress_high_attention
    condition:
      stress: {gt: 0.15}
      attention: {gt: 0.4}
    function: boost_far_in_high_arousal_direction
    description: >
      Boost FX that are far from the dry signal and lie in the direction of increasing arousal (i.e., arousal_fx > arousal_dry).
      Suppress others.

  - name: high_stress_low_attention
    condition:
      stress: {gt:  0.15}
      attention: {lt: 0.4}
    function: boost_far_any_direction
    description: >
      Boost FX that are far from the dry signal, regardless of direction.
      Suppress those that are close.

  - name: low_stress_high_attention
    condition:
      stress: {lt:  0.15}
      attention: {gt: 0.4}
    function: boost_near_only
    description: >
      Boost FX that are close to the dry signal in VA space.
      Suppress those that are far.

  - name: low_stress_low_attention
    condition:
      stress: {lt:  0.15}
      attention: {lt: 0.4}
    function: boost_near_low_arousal
    description: >
      Boost FX that are close to the dry signal and have lower arousal than the dry signal.
      Suppress FX that are far or that increase arousal.
